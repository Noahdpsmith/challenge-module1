# Code Refactor Starter Code
this repostitory is for a challenge in which i was tasked to modify a html doc and a css dog in order to make it more web accessable.
things i did inside the html and css doc would be to move the location of code to a more semantic location.  making it appear less cluttery and more organized. i as well made changes to alt atributes and overall syntax of both docs to make them more functional and to appear the way the assignment wanted. things like changing the title and the alt would make it more web accessable.
